# Python y FastAPI tutorial
This project has been created following the steps of a MoureDev course (PYTHON course from ZERO for BACKEND), in it we can find a back created by python and FastAPI where we create a basic CRUD with a JWT implementation for the login, generating a series of user tokens.

We have also created a noSQL database with mongoDB, both locally (localhost) and remotely with the help of mongoDB atlas.

In turn we have used Deta to migrate the server to the cloud and be able to access it remotely, without running locally with uvicorn.
